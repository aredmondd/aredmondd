## Hi 👋 I'm Aiden Redmond.

I'm a student-athlete at [Florida Southern College](https://www.flsouthern.edu/) pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science & a minor in Graphic Design.

- 👨🏽‍💻 I'm currently working on [aidenredmond.com](https://www.aidenredmond.com), which is my personal website.
- 🧠 I'm currently learning [React](https://www.react.dev/), [Japanese](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/aidenredmond), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
- 💬 Ask me about Laravel, Figma, or indie video games.
- ☎️ How to reach me: aidenredmondd@gmail.com.
- ⚡️ Fun fact: I usually run 75+ miles a week, I love [KAWS](https://www.artnet.com/artists/kaws/), the [Cleveland Cavaliers](https://www.nba.com/cavaliers/), collecting manga, and organizing things.
